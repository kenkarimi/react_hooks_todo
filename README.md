# react_hooks_todo

A simple project demonstrating how function components and hooks such as useState and useEffect work in react 17.

First part is a TODO app
Second part is a change state app that demonstrates how to change state in a large state object with different properties.

We also have a small third part of the app that demonstrates the minor react hooks like useContext, useRef and Custom Hooks.
